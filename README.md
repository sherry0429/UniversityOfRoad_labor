# README

this is my first android app, a very simple application to help swust (my college) new students understand them's school quickly and easily.

__this application include a comment dashboard, but it's base on a third-party web service, so now maybe it can't  work anymore.__



### why have a same repo with a suffix "labor"?

mmm, it's a history reason, i always in my Laboratory, it's network is interesting... when i develop this project, i can't access github in my browser even i use vpn.

so i have to develop computer in my laboratory, and copy it to my computer in my home.

when i develop a stable version, i push it on github.

so you can see only 6-8 commit in there repos, because many commit's in my local disk.
